# Domain modeling made functional with Haskell

The idea of this project is to study DDD with FP based on the excellent book
[Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional).
It uses F# in all the examples which is great and I enjoyed reading the code and like the language,
but my Haskell was abandoned for quite some time and I'd like to start doing something with it again.
So 2 reasons why this project exists:
 - to understand ideas from the book better by running the code
 - practice with Haskell and see how can you do the same with this wonderful language


The code I try to port resides [here](https://github.com/swlaschin/DomainModelingMadeFunctional)



## TODO

- see how to implement `String50` https://github.com/swlaschin/DomainModelingMadeFunctional/blob/master/src/OrderTaking/Common.SimpleTypes.fs#L140
